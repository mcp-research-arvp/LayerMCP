> Investigating whether transformer layer subsets drive MCP tool-routing and domain reasoning — and whether selectively fine-tuning those layers can replace full-model adaptation.

## Overview

Modern open-source LLMs are capable of tool use, function calling, and domain-specific reasoning — but little is known about *where* inside the network these capabilities reside. This project tests the hypothesis that **MCP tool-selection and domain-specialization behaviors are concentrated in a small, identifiable subset of transformer layers**, rather than being uniformly distributed across the entire model. If true, it becomes possible to create efficient domain experts by modifying only those layers — avoiding the expense of full fine-tuning while matching or exceeding its quality.

The project spans mechanistic interpretability, efficient fine-tuning, and agentic evaluation, applied to four open-source model families across four high-value domains.

## Research Questions

1. **Localization** — Are MCP tool-selection and domain-reasoning behaviors concentrated in specific transformer layers, attention heads, or MLP blocks, and does this vary across model architectures?
2. **Selective FT efficacy** — Can interpretability-guided, layer-selective fine-tuning match full fine-tuning, LoRA, and QLoRA at lower computational cost and parameter budget?
3. **Cross-domain generalization** — Does selective layer adaptation produce genuine domain experts while preserving general reasoning (i.e., avoiding catastrophic forgetting)?

## Project Phases

| Phase | Duration | Goal |
|-------|----------|------|
| **1 — MCP Benchmark** | Months 1–2 | Build a standardized evaluation harness for tool selection, function calling, and domain reasoning across finance, coding, math, and enterprise workflows |
| **2 — Layer Attribution** | Months 2–4 | Instrument models with mechanistic interpretability techniques to localize tool-routing and domain-reasoning behavior to specific layers/heads |
| **3 — Selective Fine-Tuning** | Months 3–5 | Experimentally fine-tune only the identified layers and compare against full FT, LoRA, and QLoRA on quality, compute, memory, and speed |
| **4 — Domain Experts** | Months 4–6 | Produce lightweight specialist models for finance, software engineering, mathematics, and cybersecurity; evaluate retention of general capability |

## Models Studied

| Model Family | Architecture | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **GPT-OSS** | Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) | Layer localization includes expert routing analysis |
| **Gemma** (Google) | Dense decoder | Multiple sizes; clean baseline |
| **Qwen** (Alibaba) | Dense decoder | Strong multilingual & coding baselines |
| **Llama** (Meta) | Dense decoder | Llama 3.x series; widely studied |

## Domains

- **Quantitative Finance** — instrument pricing, risk calculation, market data retrieval
- **Software Engineering** — code generation, tool-augmented debugging, repo navigation
- **Mathematics** — multi-step symbolic and numerical reasoning
- **Cybersecurity / Enterprise Automation** — policy lookup, secure API orchestration, workflow automation

---

## Methods & Techniques

### Mechanistic Interpretability
- **Activation patching / causal intervention** — swap activations between contrastive input pairs to prove causal contribution of specific layers
- **Representation probing** — linear classifiers on hidden states to test decodability of tool-choice at each layer
- **Gradient attribution** — score component importance by gradient signal toward the tool-selection output
- **Attention analysis** — identify heads that attend to tool descriptions, function signatures, and schema tokens

### Fine-Tuning Approaches (compared)
- **Full fine-tuning** — update all weights; expensive upper bound
- **LoRA** — low-rank adapters injected uniformly; ~0.1–1% parameters
- **QLoRA** — LoRA over 4-bit quantized model; fits large models on a single GPU
- **Selective-layer FT** *(proposed)* — interpretability-guided update of identified layers/heads/MLPs only
