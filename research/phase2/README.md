# Phase 2: Llama activation observability

This is a deliberately small, read-only replay harness for one saved
`llama-3.1-8b-local` **direct** tool-routing result.  It reconstructs the
router's native chat-template prompt from the saved query, ordered tool names,
and the evaluator's live MCP catalog; it then makes one ordinary generation and
one teacher-forced observation pass.  The observation pass saves only selected
tool-name and argument key/value token positions from configured layers:

- the transformer block output (`residual_stream`);
- the self-attention block output (`attention_block`); and
- the MLP block output (`mlp_block`).

It never changes the model, evaluator, benchmark, or saved source artifact.
The hooks only copy selected tensors to CPU and are removed even if replay
raises an exception.  No full attention maps or all-token activation tensors
are written.
Set `observation_enabled: false` in a config to make the same ordinary replay
without installing any hooks or saving activation tensors.

Run from the repository root with a local Llama checkpoint available:

```bash
python -m research.phase2.observe \
  --config research/phase2/configs/llama_direct_development.json
```

Use `LAYERMCP_LLAMA31_8B_CHECKPOINT` or the config's optional `checkpoint`
field to choose the custom-runtime checkpoint.  The development config points
to an older saved artifact deliberately marked `development_only`; its recorded
source commit is retained in the config and it is not headline benchmark
evidence.  Prompt tokenization uses the router's `encode_chat` method, including
its native-template fallback.  A prompt is exact only if its saved and live MCP
registry metadata match.  The generated `provenance.json` makes this visible
through `registry_exact_match`.

Each enabled-observation output directory contains `provenance.json`, selected
tensors in `activations.pt`, and `OBSERVATION_COMPLETE`. Disabled observation
records provenance and `OBSERVATION_COMPLETE`, but deliberately writes no
activation tensor file. These outputs are inputs for
later **read-only probing** and, only after a separate approved design,
causal/intervention experiments.  This harness does not implement training,
LoRA/QLoRA, activation patching, or ablation.
